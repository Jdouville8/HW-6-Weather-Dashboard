# HW-6-Weather-Dashboard

# Approach

Layout:
I used bootstrap to create a layout and some additional CSS to style things additionally

Local Storage:
I had the most difficulty with this piece, as demonstrated by the large if statement at the top of my Javascript. I was able to get this working through use of a count variable and some string concatenation.

APIs:
I used the main open weather API for all information except the UV index and 5-day forecast which I used the Onecall API for.

Unsolved date issue:
I could not figure out how to get unix time-code into a regular date
